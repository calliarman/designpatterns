Serialization in Java is a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a byte-stream.
It is mainly used in Hibernate, RMI, JPA, EJB and JMS technologies.

For serializing the object, we call the writeObject() method ObjectOutputStream.
For deserialization we call the readObject() method of ObjectInputStream class.
